This project involves the development of advanced Power BI dashboards for data modeling, analysis, and visualization. The aim is to create interactive reports that provide insights into customer metrics, product details, and business KPIs.

## Contents

1. **Data Import and Transformation Guide**: Instructions on importing and transforming data from various sources such as Azure SQL Database and Azure Blob Storage, focusing on:
   - Ensuring data privacy by removing sensitive information.
   - Splitting date and time into separate fields.
   - Standardizing table structures and column names.

2. **Data Modeling and Analysis Guide**: A step-by-step guide to constructing a robust data model, which includes:
   - Creating a continuous date table for time intelligence.
   - Developing a star schema for efficient data relationships.
   - Implementing DAX measures for dynamic calculations.
   - Establishing hierarchies for in-depth temporal and geographical analysis.

3. **Visualization Guides**: Detailed walkthroughs for crafting visual reports on Power BI, including:
   - Executive Summary Page: Highlighting key business metrics with card visuals and time-series charts.
   - Customer Detail Page: Analyzing customer behavior using donut and line charts, along with interactive slicers.
   - Product Detail Report: Focusing on product performance with gauges, area charts, scatter graphs, and more.
