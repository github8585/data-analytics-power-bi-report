   - **2.2. Revenue per Customer**: In the Measures Table, define [Revenue per Customer] as the ratio of [Total Revenue] to [Total Customers], and display it using a card visual.
   - **2.3. Top Customer Insights**: Create three card visuals to feature the top customer's name, their order count, and the cumulative revenue they've generated.

4. **Tabular Visualization**
